_Last updated: 2026-06-11_

This document contains the privacy policy and agreement you accept when adding any of the below mentioned Bots to a server, or use them as a member of a Server. This document does not supersede any of the terms laid out by Discord.

### Terminology

-   **Discord** – The chat platform hosted and operated by Discord Inc.
-   **User** – Any Discord account that uses a Service in any way
-   **Server** – A server on Discord, also known as a “Guild”
-   **Server Member** – Anyone who is a member of Server to which one of the bots has been added
-   **Server Manager** – A Server Member that has the ability to add Bots to a Server and/or configure a Bot for a Server
-   **Bot** – An automated user on Discord denominated by the “BOT” tag
-   **Associated Service** – A service hosted outside Discord to offer additional functionality to a Bot

### Bots and Services

This privacy policy applies to the following Bot.

-   **WikiLogger**#2453 (1215652798490877982)

### What data we collect

We collect data with different scenarios, each scenario covered by this Policy will be explained below.

#### Collected by command

The following data may be collected and temporarily stored when intentionally provided by a User via usage of a function of a Bot, hence this data is not collected automatically. Should a User provide data in this manner, they forego any rights pertaining to the content of the data provided.

-   Server specific configuration settings
-   Data and content for the task called
-   Saved references, URLs, or text
-   Analytical data
    -   Command arguments (e.g. search terms)

#### Automatically collected

This data may be collected automatically by some Services. This data is used to facilitate critical functionality of Services, and are vital to its operation.

-   Any data needed for standard operation of Bots, such as Server permissions and members. This data is stored in the cache of the Bot, and will not be stored long-term.

### Why we collect data

We collect data to facilitate functions of Services, and to provide us with analytical data about Bots’ usage and behavioral patterns.

### Who we share data with

We don’t share data with any 3rd party for any reason whatsoever, unless required by law.

### How your data is stored

All data is stored on protected infrastructure. While storage methods may vary between Services, most data will be stored within enterprise-standard databases such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (persistent) or [Redis](https://redis.io/) (cache). Please keep in mind that even with the highest standard of protection, no data can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to keep data secure and private at all times, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

### How long your data is retained

Data collected via command, meaning collected via explicit understanding that the data is going to be saved (cache), is retained for as long as the instance of the Bot runs. The exception for this is analytical data, which is stored indefinitely. Data retained via events is as follows:

#### When a message is created
Data is stored in PostgreSQL, and deleted after two days time or upon message deletion.

#### When a member joins a Server with the Bot present
Invite codes from Discord are stored short-term in Redis.

#### When an archive is created
When a message bulk delete event is received, a human-readable transcript of these messages will be stored for two weeks at the preview site, https://logger-discord-bot.toolforge.org

### Your rights to your data

You have the right to have your data deleted from the Service.

Should you wish to enforce one of these rights, please email us at [ent3rm4n@gmail.com](mailto:ent3rm4n@gmail.com), I will strive to respond to your request within 30 days.

### Feedback

Feedback concerning any of the outlined Services is appreciated. However, you agree that upon submission of feedback, you forego any rights to the content, title, or intent of the provided feedback. Additionally, the feedback you provide may be used in any way.

### Agreement

By utilizing any of the before mentioned Services, you are consenting to the policies outlined in this document. Additionally, you, the Server Manager, agree to inform other Server Members in your Server about the contents of this document.

If you, the Server Manager, do not agree to the terms laid out in this document, you may remove the Bots from the server and stop using Associated Services.

If you, the Server Member, do not agree to the terms laid out in this document, you may leave Servers that contain any of the before mentioned Bots, additionally you may revoke authorization of the Service in your “Authorized Apps” menu on Discord.
